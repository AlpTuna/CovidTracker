# CovidTracker

Covid Tracker is a software that tracks the instantaneous number of cases and deaths all around the world. It is made using Python and Parsehub. With Covid Tracker, you can do the followings:

1 - Get instantaneous number of cases and deaths worldwide
2 - Get instantaneous number of cases and deaths for any country
3 - Sort the countries by number of cases
4 - Sort the countries by number of deaths
5 - Get the exact ranking of any country
6 - Save all the data in a .txt file
7 - Refresh the data at anytime

Covid Tracker uses different algorithms and data structures. Some algorithms used in this project are sorting algorithms, list comprehensions, string formattings, reading and writing files. The project also retrieves data from the Parsehub servers and creates/deletes runs when needed.

NOTE: I got the idea of making the COVID Tracker app by the youtuber 'Tech With Tim' (https://github.com/techwithtim). Big thanks to him for showing the fundamentals of ParseHub and the basics of the project.
